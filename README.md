# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Talki is an application to send and receive msg between users on the selected channel.

I like this assignment. My biggest challenge was to undestand the complexity of the comunication between the server and the user, once I make it clear, everything was easier.
My personal touch was to be able of sending images.


index.html
Have the html code and for the dynamic information as the messages handlebars was used. The handlebars will check who sent the message and if it was an img or a text and shift the display of themessage according to that.

application.py
Here al the information as messages, images and channels are saved and sending to the client when is requested.

project2.js
All the javascript code is here. Almost all the changes in the page are made by JavaScript. It will make requests to the server and change the page depending of this information.

styles.css
Just a little code for the style and user expierence.
